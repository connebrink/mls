# My Ls
There are more and more new tools created with rust as replacement for  
some core tools like **ls**. But I wonder why not new versions of such  
core utilities apps with modern C++. I will try it with this project  
for the ls command. I hope it will be alot of fun.

# Features 
- Try to be compatible with **ls** 
- Fancy colors and other more fancy stuff
- Fast of course, hopefully
- Support for static builds
- No Dependencies
- Easy C++
